# Task 1: Code Refactoring

In this task, I refactored five old code snippets to enhance their readability and maintainability. The codes were rewritten to use descriptive variable names and structured comments that explain their purpose without being overly verbose. Each function is now clearly defined, with necessary comments added to improve understanding. This process has helped me apply clean coding practices effectively.
