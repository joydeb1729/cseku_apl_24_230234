# Football Club Management System

## Overview

The **Football Club Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage various aspects of a football club, including clubs, teams, players, staff, sponsors, and stadiums. It employs the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern to ensure that the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable.

This project aims to streamline the management of football club data by organizing and representing information such as team rosters, player profiles, staff details, sponsorships, and stadium information in a structured and user-friendly manner.

## Features

- **Club Management**: Store and manage football club details such as achievements, teams, and players.
- **Team Management**: Manage teams, players, and team-specific information (e.g., roster, performance).
- **Player Management**: Store player information for both junior and senior players, including name, position, and age.
- **Staff Management**: Manage staff roles, including coaches and other support staff.
- **Stadium Management**: Manage stadium details and their associated information.
- **Sponsor Management**: Track sponsorship details for the club.

## Project Structure

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern. Here’s a breakdown of the project structure:

## MVC Architecture

The **Football Club Management System** strictly adheres to the **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Here’s how the pattern has been implemented:

### 1. **Model Layer (Data Layer)**

The **Model** represents the data and business logic of the application. In this system, the model handles all the data related to clubs, teams, players, staff, stadiums, and sponsors.

- **Models**: Classes like `Club`, `Team`, `Player`, `Staff`, `Stadium`, and `Sponsor` are responsible for holding and manipulating the data related to the respective entities. These classes encapsulate all the attributes and behaviors (methods) for each entity.
  
- **Interfaces**: For each entity, an interface is defined (e.g., `IClub`, `IPlayer`, `IStaff`) that ensures consistency across different models. The models implement these interfaces, which define the core operations (e.g., adding players, updating team details) for each class.

- **Business Logic**: All core business logic (e.g., team composition, player eligibility) resides in the model classes. For instance, the `Team` model manages the list of players and performs operations like adding or removing players.

### 2. **View Layer (Presentation Layer)**

The **View** is responsible for displaying information to the user and receiving input. It provides the user interface of the system.

- **Views**: The `ClubView` class implements the `IView` interface and is used to display information about the football club, including the club’s name, achievements, teams, and players. It is responsible for rendering data to the user in a readable format.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The view is only concerned with how to display information. It doesn’t handle data processing or interaction with the model. It relies on the controller to fetch the necessary data from the model and update the view accordingly.

### 3. **Controller Layer (Interaction Layer)**

The **Controller** acts as the intermediary between the **Model** and the **View**. It listens to user input from the view, processes the input (if necessary), and updates the model. After the model is updated, the controller will update the view to reflect any changes.

- **Controllers**: The `ClubController` class is responsible for interacting with the model (e.g., `Club`, `Team`, `Player`) and updating the view accordingly. It fetches the necessary data from the models, processes it, and calls the corresponding methods in the view to display the data to the user.

- **Decoupling**: The controller is decoupled from the view and the model through the use of interfaces. This allows for easy modifications and testing without affecting other components.

## How MVC is Used

The use of **MVC** helps in organizing the code and allows for easier maintenance, testing, and expansion. Here’s how each layer contributes:

- **Model**: The model holds all the data and performs business operations (e.g., adding a player to a team). It does not interact directly with the user interface.
- **View**: The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It listens for changes in the data from the controller and updates the UI accordingly.
- **Controller**: The controller coordinates the actions between the model and the view. It listens to the user inputs from the view, performs any necessary data processing, and then updates both the model and the view.

This separation ensures that each component can evolve independently. For example, if we want to add a new type of view (like a graphical interface), the controller and model remain unaffected.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply compile the Java files and execute the `Main` class. You will be able to interact with the club management system, adding and viewing information about clubs, teams, players, staff, stadiums, and sponsors.

## Dependencies

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management (if required)

## Conclusion

This project showcases the implementation of the **MVC** design pattern to manage a football club system. By following **MVC**, the project ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, making it easier to expand and maintain over time.
